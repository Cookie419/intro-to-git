# Working Directory
-Area where all the files, directories and changes are living all the time.

# Staging Area
- Files and directories that we explicitly add to the staging area.

# Git Repository
-Where all our snapshots are stored.

# Adding multiple files of a certain file type
Use a wild card noted as *. type  "git add *.html"  and all files of that type are added.

# Adding all files in directory (including hidden)
Note: git add -A adds all files and folders from the directory that you're in.
This is a good command for adding everything in your project, all at one time.

# Removing files
Never did find a really good way. tried all Git suggestions . Finally had to add,commit, and then manually delete files by hand to remove them. What!!! a chore. Nothing worked.
# Ignoring files
Set up gitignore and type in code console, what you want it to ignore. Possible that won't work either.
